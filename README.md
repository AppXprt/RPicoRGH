# RPicoRGH
RGH 1.2 for Xbox 360 on a Raspberry Pi Pico

Forked version of Trinity model made by Bal√°zs Triszka (2022)

Some feedback and improvements to support other Xbox 360 models.

# TODO
- Add pin scheme for each Xbox 360 model, although by objective, the Xenon, Opus and Zephyr versions; since the Falcon, Jasper and onwards, have their methods for RGH3
- Compile the uf2 file
